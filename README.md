# üìä User Analytics ‚Äî U.S. Role Segmentation & Premium Conversion Analysis

This project explores user behavior and job role distribution across a U.S.-based professional platform. Using a large dataset of 7.5 million anonymized users, I analyzed geographic patterns in job roles, segmented tech and project management positions, and investigated upgrade behavior within the first 24 hours of signup.

> Built as part of a data science challenge, this project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, engineer meaningful features, and communicate insights visually with Python and interactive HTML exports.
